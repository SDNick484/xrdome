# xrdome

A Linux player for VR180 video on XR glasses (Viture Pro XR, XREAL Air 2 Pro) with head tracking.

Status: design and plan are written, implementation has not started. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-11-xrdome-design.md` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-11-xrdome.md`.

## System setup

Head tracking comes from [XRLinuxDriver](https://github.com/wheaney/XRLinuxDriver), run by hand.
Its installer requires systemd, so on OpenRC it is unpacked and started manually.

### udev rules and group

`/etc/udev/rules.d/70-viture-xr.rules`:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="35ca", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", KERNEL=="hiddev[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="35ca", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyACM[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="35ca", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", KERNEL=="hidraw[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="35ca", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
```

`/etc/udev/rules.d/70-xreal-xr.rules` (not yet tested on hardware):

```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="3318", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", KERNEL=="hidraw[0-9]*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="3318", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
```

```sh
getent group plugdev || groupadd plugdev
gpasswd -a "$USER" plugdev
udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Replug the glasses and log in again. Until the next login, `sg plugdev -c '<command>'` runs a command with the group active.

Without group access the driver still finds the glasses but fails with
`open_imu failed ... USB execution error`.

### Driver

Unpack `xrDriver-x86_64.tar.gz` and `xrDriver-libs-x86_64.tar.gz` from the XRLinuxDriver releases page.
Do not run `xr_driver_setup`.

`~/.config/xr_driver/config.ini`:

```
disabled=false
output_mode=external_only
external_mode=opentrack
opentrack_app_ip=127.0.0.1
opentrack_app_port=4242
metrics_disabled=true
```

`disabled=false` is required: the driver defaults to disabled.

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/xr_driver_lib /path/to/xr_driver/bin/xrDriver
```

`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` must be the directory holding both `libglasses.so` and `libGlassSDK.so`.
The log is `~/.local/state/xr_driver/driver.log`.

Verify: `tcpdump -n -i lo udp port 4242 -c 20` shows `UDP, length 52`, and `tools/ot_dump.py` prints angles.

## Tracking notes

Measured 2026-11-11, Viture Pro XR (`35ca:101d`), XRLinuxDriver 2.11.9, Gentoo/OpenRC:

- About 365 packets per second, no malformed packets.
- The packet carries the driver's NWU Euler angles: `q = Rz_up(yaw) * Ry_left(pitch) * Rx_forward(roll)`.
- The pose is absolute in the driver's own world frame. Looking level and forward read roughly
  yaw -157, pitch 12, roll -176, so raw angles are not usable directly.
- Rotation relative to a reference pose, `conj(q_ref) * q`, has standard NWU body axes:
  head left is positive about up, looking up is negative about left, right ear down is positive about forward.
- Yaw drift over time: not measured yet.
